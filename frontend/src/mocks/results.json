        "abstract": "The orbital period of a cataclysmic variable stands as a crucial parameter for investigating the structure and physics of these binary systems, as well as understanding their evolution. We use photometric Gaia data for dwarf novae (DNe) in the quiescent state which are available for a number of years to determine new orbital periods and improve/modify previously suggested values. Two approaches are implemented for selecting high-inclination targets, either eclipsing or with ellipsoidal variations. We determine new orbital periods for 75 DNe and improve ephemerides for 27 more (three of which change significantly), contributing 9.4% of the known DNe periods of 0.05-2.0 days, and doubling the number of known periods exceeding 0.44 days. Their phase-folded light curves are presented and arranged by orbital period, illustrating the transition from short-period systems, dominated by radiation from the accretion disc and the hot spot, to longer-period DNe, where the Roche-lobe-filling secondary star is the primary visual flux source. This transition -- which occurs around the well-known period gap (around 2-3 hours) -- is expected, as DNe with larger orbital periods typically harbour more massive donors, which contribute to the visible flux. However, this transition is not abrupt. Within the same range of periods, we observe systems dominated by ellipsoidal variations, where the companion star is clearly visible, as well as others dominated by the disc and hot spot. The presence of some DNe with ellipsoidal variations near the lower edge of the period gap is striking, as the companions in these systems are expected to be cool low-mass M-dwarfs not visible in the light curve. This could indicate that we are observing systems where the donor star was originally much more massive and underwent significant nuclear evolution before mass-transfer began, as has been suggested previously for QZ Ser.",

        "conclusion": "This study determined new orbital periods for 75 dwarf novae (DNe) and improved or modified ephemerides for 27 more, contributing 9.4% to the known DNe population with periods between 0.05 and 2.0 days.  Significantly, the number of known periods exceeding 0.44 days was doubled.  The analysis revealed a non-abrupt transition in light curve characteristics around the period gap (∼2-3 hours), with systems exhibiting either orbital humps (shorter periods, dominated by disc and hot spot) or ellipsoidal variations (longer periods, dominated by the companion star).  Surprisingly, ellipsoidal variations were observed in some DNe close to the lower edge of the period gap, where companion stars are predicted to be unseen low-mass M-dwarfs, suggesting the donor stars may have undergone significant evolution before mass transfer commenced.  The results substantially increase the population of known DNe with orbital periods, especially those above 0.44 days, offering valuable data for understanding cataclysmic variable evolution.\n",

This dimming, lasting approximately 6 hours, is attributed to CME-induced depletion of coronal material.  Simultaneously, a 15% increase in the emission line width was observed, indicating an increase in Doppler temperature from ≈2.7×10⁶ K to ≈3.6×10⁶ K. A non-thermal velocity of ≈24.87 km/s was also calculated. Doppler velocity measurements showed a redshift of ≈10 km/s, suggesting a possible deflection of the CME by the ambient magnetic field.  The observed event, an X1.9 class flare, was detected approximately 1 hour prior to its appearance in the SoHO/LASCO-C2 field of view.\n",

This work highlights the observations now available from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument suite onboard Solar Orbiter while operating in short exposure mode.   Methods: A selection of noteworthy flares observed simultaneously by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and the Full Sun Imager of EUI (EUI/FSI) are detailed. New insights are highlighted and potential avenues of investigation are demonstrated, including forward modelling the atmospheric response to a non-thermal beam of electrons using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code, in order to compare the predicted and observed EUV emission.   Results: The examples given in this work demonstrate that short exposure EUI/FSI observations are providing important diagnostics during flares. A dataset of more than 9000 flares observed by STIX (from November 2022 until December 2023) with at least one short exposure EUI/FSI 174 \\r{A} image is currently available. The observations reveal that the brightest parts of short-exposure observations consist of substructure in flaring ribbons which spatially overlap with the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX in the majority of cases. We show that these observations provide an opportunity to further constrain the electron energy flux required for flare modelling, among other potential applications.",

The results indicate that the CAE model outperforms the DAE model in reconstructing Stokes profiles, demonstrating greater robustness and achieving reconstruction errors around the observational noise level.

The rotational velocity distributions of $\\delta$ Sct and $\\gamma$ Dor stars are extremely similar, with the only difference potentially due to the rotational variable stars that have not been completely removed. In contrast, the rotational velocity distribution of normal stars is more dispersed compared to pulsating stars. Additionally, the peak rotational velocity of the pulsating stars is about 10 km s$^{-1}$ higher than that of normal stars. Unlike the normal stars, which show a monotonic increase in peak velocity with mass between 1.8 and 2.5 $M_{\\odot}$, the rotational velocity distribution of $\\delta$ Sct stars does not exhibit a strong mass dependence. We also found that normal stars accelerate during the late main-sequence evolutionary phase, while $\\delta$ Sct stars decelerate. Furthermore, there may still be unclassified stars with diverse rotational properties in the normal star sample compared to the $\\delta$ Sct stars, which is likely to be an important contributor to the broader dispersion observed in its rotational velocity distribution.

Normal stars display a broader distribution compared to pulsating stars, encompassing a larger proportion of both slowly and rapidly rotating stars.  Peak rotational velocities are marginally higher for pulsating stars.  A statistically significant difference was found between the distributions of δ Sct and normal stars within the 10th to 90th percentile range.  While normal stars show a monotonic increase in peak velocity with mass between 1.8 and 2.5 M⊙, δ Sct stars show little mass dependence.  Normal stars accelerate in their rotation during late main sequence evolution, while δ Sct stars decelerate.  The results suggest that pulsations in δ Sct and γ Dor stars may facilitate angular momentum transport from the stellar interior to the surface.  A clear correlation was found between photometric amplitude and rotation in δ Sct stars, with high-amplitude stars rotating more slowly, contrasting with the broad distribution of low-amplitude stars.  Conversely, no significant amplitude-rotation relationship was detected in γ Dor stars.\n",

As a result, the flow becomes unstable. For a weak field, this instability is symmetric, while for strong fields it is asymmetric.

While in transport, high-$Z$ solar energetic particles (SEPs) with energies of $\\sim$1 MeV/nuc leave damage tracks as they pass through IDPs. SEP track densities can be used as a measure of a grain's space exposure and in turn, help to constrain their lifetimes and origins. Stratospherically collected IDPs with relatively high track densities ($>10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$) have been interpreted as originating from the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. To further test this hypothesis, we use a dynamical dust grain tracing model to explore the accumulation of SEP tracks within EKB dust grains. We demonstrate that, neglecting collisions, dust grains with radii up to 500 $\\mu$m are capable of transiting from the EKB to 1 au despite gravitational perturbations from the outer planets, albeit with decreasing probability as a function of size. Despite this, we find that EKB grains cannot accumulate sufficient tracks to match those reported in the terrestrial stratospheric IDP collection when applying SEP track accumulation rates established from lunar samples at 1 au and assuming the SEP flux scales with heliocentric distance as $r^{-1.7}$. By exploring the radial scaling of the SEP flux, we find that a shallower SEP radial distribution of $r^{-1.0}$ does allow for the accumulation of $>$$10^{10}$ tracks cm$^{-2}$ in EKB dust grains that reach 1 au. We urge further research into the propagation and distribution of high-$Z$ SEPs throughout the heliosphere in order to better constrain track accumulation in IDPs.",

A shallower radial scaling of r<sup>-1.0</sup> for the high-Z SEP flux better matched the observed track densities.  The study emphasizes the need for a more precise understanding of high-Z SEP propagation throughout the heliosphere, noting that current models using proton SEP flux scaling are inadequate.  Additional factors, such as collisions and contributions from other particle sources like anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs), are discussed as potential contributors to the observed track densities, and warrant further investigation.\n",

        "abstract": "In this Paper we determine the non-dissipative tidal evolution of a close binary system with an arbitrary eccentricity in which the spin angular momenta of both components is misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. We focus on the situation where the orbital angular momentum dominates the spin angular momenta and so remains at small inclination to the conserved total angular momentum. Torques arising from rotational distortion and tidal distortion taking account of Coriolis forces are included. This extends the previous work of Ivanov & Papaloizou relaxing the limitation resulting from the assumption that one of the components is compact and has zero spin angular momentum. Unlike the above study, the evolution of spin-orbit inclination angles is driven by both types of torque. We develop a simple analytic theory describing the evolution of orbital angles and compare it with direct numerical simulations. We find that the tidal torque prevails near 'critical curves' in parameter space where the time-averaged apsidal precession rate is close to zero. In the limit of small spin, these curves exist only for systems that have at least one component with retrograde rotation. As in our previous work, we find solutions close to these curves for which the apsidal angle librates. As noted there, this could result in oscillation between prograde and retrograde states. We consider the application of our approach to systems with parameters similar to those of the misaligned binary DI Her.",

        "conclusion": "This paper extends previous work on the non-dissipative tidal evolution of close binary systems with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta by allowing both components to be non-compact.  The evolution of spin-orbit inclination angles is driven by both rotational distortion and tidal distortion torques, considering Coriolis forces.  Analysis, both analytic and numerical, demonstrates libration and circulation of the apsidal angle near critical curves in parameter space where the time-averaged apsidal precession rate is zero.  For small spin, these curves exist only for systems with at least one retrograde rotation.  The results are compared to a model system with parameters similar to those of the misaligned binary DI Her, finding good agreement with numerical simulations, particularly in the case of the secondary component.  The findings suggest that the effect of both components' spin angular momenta on the orbital evolution is significant, leading to potentially chaotic behavior near separatrix solutions, and highlight the relevance of the results for understanding the evolution of misaligned binary systems, such as DI Her.\n",
