        "summary": "**Summary of \"New orbital periods of high-inclination dwarf novae based on Gaia Alerts photometry\" by Sáez-Carvajal et al.**\n\n**1. Main objective and motivation:**\n\nThe paper aims to determine new orbital periods and refine existing ones for high-inclination dwarf novae (DNe), a type of cataclysmic variable (CV) binary system.  Accurate orbital periods are crucial for understanding the structure, physics, and evolution of these systems, particularly regarding the elusive \"period gap\" where systems with periods around 2-3 hours are underrepresented. The study leverages high-quality but often sparse Gaia Alerts photometry to address this gap in the existing data.\n\n**2. Key methods and approaches:**\n\nThe authors utilize two approaches to select high-inclination targets: identifying systems exhibiting eclipses or ellipsoidal variations in their light curves.  They employ the following methods:\n\n* **Eclipse Timing:**  A code is developed to systematically search for potential orbital periods based on observed eclipse times.  The method minimizes the sum of absolute differences between calculated and expected cycle numbers for successive eclipses, yielding the most likely period.\n* **Lomb-Scargle Periodogram:**  Applied to identify a first approximation of the orbital period, overcoming the limitations of irregular Gaia data.  A visual inspection of phase-folded light curves near the detected peak period is used for precise period determination.\n* **Ephemeris Determination:**  A linear least-squares fit is employed to determine precise ephemerides (orbital period and epoch) based on the collected eclipse times, improving on existing values or establishing new ones.\n\nThe analysis focuses on Gaia Alerts photometry data, specifically g-band data from the VSX catalogue, selecting quiescent state observations to avoid outburst artifacts.  A magnitude limit of g > 21 and a minimum of ~40 quiescent observations are applied to ensure data reliability.\n\n**3. Principal findings and results:**\n\nThe study successfully determined orbital periods for 75 DNe previously unknown and refined or modified ephemerides for 27 additional systems.  This constitutes a significant contribution to the existing dataset, especially for longer periods (> 0.44 days), effectively doubling the number of known periods in that range.\n\n* **Period Distribution:**  The study confirms the existence of a period gap around 2-3 hours, but also shows that the transition from systems dominated by accretion disc/hotspot emission to those dominated by ellipsoidal variations from the secondary star is not abrupt. The authors highlight the presence of ellipsoidal variations even at orbital periods where the secondary star is expected to be a cool, faint M-dwarf, indicating possible evolutionary histories of significantly evolved donor stars before mass transfer.\n\n* **Phase-folded Light Curves:** A comprehensive collection of 117 phased-folded light curves are presented, showcasing the diverse behavior of DNe in quiescence across the period range.  The light curves clearly delineate the transition from orbital humps (shorter periods) to double-hump patterns indicative of ellipsoidal variations (longer periods). Strikingly, some relatively short-period systems show the double-hump feature, challenging the predicted behavior of the secondary star in such cases.\n\n* **Contribution to VSX Data:** The newly determined and refined periods represent a 9.4% increase in the total population of DNe with known periods and significantly improve the population of long-period systems, highlighting the importance of the study.\n\n**4. Significance and implications:**\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the orbital period distribution of DNe and the nature of their secondary stars, including potential evolutionary implications for systems near the period gap.\n\n* **Period Gap Characterization:** The results are crucial in understanding the behavior of CVs during and around the period gap, helping to refine existing models. The observed prevalence of ellipsoidal variations at short periods hints at the importance of donor evolution, potentially challenging the standard \"disrupted magnetic braking\" model.\n\n* **Expanded Dataset:**  The significantly expanded database of DNe orbital periods greatly enhances our understanding of CV evolution and mass-transfer processes. This refined dataset will be valuable for future studies investigating the relationship between orbital periods, mass-transfer rates, and physical properties within CV binaries.  The additional tables of data are particularly significant for supporting further analysis.\n\n* **Gaia's Potential:** The study validates the use of Gaia Alerts data for determining orbital periods of DNe, showing that even sparse, irregularly distributed data can yield valuable results with careful analysis and the proper methodology, particularly for objects with longer orbital periods.\n",

This transition is not abrupt; a mixture of types is observed around the period gap.\n* **Evolved donors near the period gap:**  The presence of ellipsoidal variations in systems near the period gap suggests that the donor stars in these systems may have already evolved significantly, potentially being helium-rich stars.\n* **Ground-based photometry limitations:** Ground-based observations may be less effective for determining the orbital periods of long-period systems, contributing to the paucity of known periods in that range.\n\n\n**Questions for the Authors:**\n\n1.

        "summary": "**Summary of \"Gl 725A b: a potential super-Earth detected with SOPHIE and SPIRou in an M dwarf binary system at 3.5 pc\"**\n\n**1. Main objective and motivation:**\n\nThe paper aims to confirm the existence of a low-mass planet orbiting the nearby M dwarf star Gl 725A using high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from both optical (SOPHIE) and near-infrared (SPIRou) spectrographs. The primary motivation is the prevalence of low-mass planets around M dwarfs and the difficulty in distinguishing true planetary signals from stellar activity noise, especially in the case of M dwarf binaries.  The study is particularly focused on Gl 725A as it is a relatively close and low-activity M dwarf in a binary system, offering a unique opportunity for detailed characterization.\n\n**2. Key methods and approaches:**\n\nThe study utilizes high-precision RV measurements from both SOPHIE and SPIRou, employing different wavelength regimes to address the chromatic nature of stellar activity.  The data reduction process for both instruments includes sophisticated methods to correct for instrumental systematics, telluric contamination (specifically addressed with the Wapiti method for SPIRou), and stellar activity using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR).  The RV time series are analyzed using generalized Lomb-Scargle and stacked Bayesian generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms to identify periodic signals. Independent Keplerian fits are performed on data from each instrument, followed by a joint analysis to maximize detection confidence and refine the model.  The detection of a signal is further validated with an injection-recovery test in the RV residuals, and a transit search in TESS photometry was conducted.\n\n**3. Principal findings and results:**\n\nA significant planetary signal with a period of 11.2201 ± 0.0051 days is detected independently by both SOPHIE and SPIRou, strongly suggesting a planetary origin. The RV semi-amplitude is 1.67 ± 0.20 m/s, which translates to a minimum planet mass of Mp sin i = 2.78 ± 0.35 M⊕. This places the planet in the super-Earth regime.  The best-fit model, incorporating two independent Gaussian Processes (one for each instrument) to account for stellar activity, significantly improves the fit to the data and strongly favors a circular orbit over an eccentric one.  The analysis indicates a low level of activity-induced RV variability for Gl 725A, which is consistent with the star’s long rotation period (103.1 ± 6.1 days).  No transit signal was detected in TESS photometry, and statistical analysis (True/False Inclusion Probabilities) corroborates this non-transiting status. Mass-radius relationships are used to estimate a likely planetary radius of ~1.4 R⊕.\n\n**4. Significance and implications:**\n\nThe discovery of Gl 725A b represents a significant addition to the population of low-mass planets in short periods around nearby M dwarfs. This confirms the commonality of super-Earths in such systems.  The use of joint optical and near-infrared observations provides a robust detection method for low-mass exoplanets by mitigating the impact of stellar activity.  The proximity of Gl 725A b to Earth allows for future follow-up observations with a variety of techniques to further characterize its properties.  Furthermore, the study contributes to refining understanding of the prevalence and formation of planets around M dwarf binaries. The findings highlight the increasing efficacy of multi-wavelength RV measurements in detecting and characterizing exoplanets, particularly those orbiting low-mass stars.\n",

        "summary": "**Summary of \"New results on the onset of a coronal mass ejection from 5303˚A emission line observations with VELC/ADITYA-L1\"**\n\n**1. Main objective and motivation:**\n\nThe study aims to use spectroscopic observations of the 5303Å coronal emission line, obtained by the VELC instrument on the ADITYA-L1 mission, to characterize the onset of a coronal mass ejection (CME).  The motivation is to improve our understanding of the thermodynamic changes in the near-Sun corona during CMEs, a crucial step in predicting space weather events.  Prior research on CMEs using similar techniques from ground-based and space-based instruments (e.g., LASCO) is limited, especially concerning dynamic events near the solar limb, motivating the present work.\n\n**2. Key methods and approaches:**\n\nThe study utilizes the VELC/ADITYA-L1 instrument, a coronagraph capable of both imaging and spectroscopy in the 5303Å line, and other complementary observations, including STEREO-A/EUVI data, SOHO/LASCO-C2 observations, and GOES soft X-ray data.  The authors analyze data acquired using both sit-and-stare and raster scan modes, providing spatial and temporal variations of spectral parameters (intensity, width, Doppler shift) within a specific region of interest near the solar west limb.  The spectroscopic data is analyzed by fitting Gaussian profiles to the emission lines, allowing for the determination of peak intensity, line width, and Doppler velocity.  Comparisons with data from other instruments and historical observations provide context for the detected phenomena.\n\n**3. Principal findings and results:**\n\nOn 16 July 2024, a CME associated with an X1.9 class flare was observed.  VELC observations reveal a significant dimming (~50%) in the 5303Å emission line intensity around ≈13:18 UT in a specific spatial location. This dimming was concurrent with a localized Hα flare.  The emission line width increased by ~15% during the dimming period, indicative of an increase in the Doppler temperature from ~2.7×10<sup>6</sup> K to ~3.6×10<sup>6</sup> K.  A non-thermal velocity of ~24.87 km/s was estimated.  Doppler velocity analysis indicated an outflow from the region, showing a redshift (~10 km/s) suggesting a deflection of the CME by the ambient magnetic field.  The onset time of the CME at 1 R⊙ was estimated to be ~13:48 UT based on a 2nd order fit to height-time measurements from SOHO/LASCO.  The estimated speed in the plane-of-sky was ~393 km/s. The observations strongly suggest that the 5303Å dimming was a direct consequence of CME-induced material depletion.\n\n**4. Significance and implications:**\n\nThe study provides the first spectroscopic observations of a CME onset in the 5303Å emission line using the VELC instrument.  These results offer valuable insights into the early stages of CME development and the associated coronal changes. The combined analysis of intensity, width, and Doppler shift provides multi-faceted information for CME modelling and forecasting.  The observed timing relationship with other solar phenomena (flare, radio burst, CME in SOHO/LASCO) strengthens the causal link between the eruption and the observed dimming.  Further synoptic observations with VELC and other instruments will refine the understanding of CME onset and evolution, improving space weather prediction models. The data helps constrain the input parameters in CME simulations.\n",

        "summary": "**Solar flares in the Solar Orbiter Era: Short exposure EUI/FSI observations of STIX flares**\n\n**1. Main objective and motivation:**\n\nThe paper aims to demonstrate the utility of short-exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares, particularly those captured by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on Solar Orbiter in short exposure mode.  The primary motivation is to overcome the saturation issues prevalent in standard EUV imagers during large flares, enabling detailed study of the spatial and temporal evolution of the flare ribbons and their relation to hard X-ray (HXR) emission, crucial for understanding particle acceleration, heating, and energy partitioning.\n\n**2. Key methods and approaches:**\n\nThe study focuses on a selection of flares simultaneously observed by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and EUI/Full Sun Imager (FSI) in short-exposure mode.  A key method involves comparing STIX HXR observations with corresponding short-exposure EUI/FSI images in the 174 Å passband.  The authors employ a forward modeling approach using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code to simulate the atmospheric response to a non-thermal electron beam inferred from STIX observations.  The simulated response is then compared with the observed EUV emission.  A curated flarelist of STIX flares with corresponding short exposure EUI/FSI data is created from operational STIX flare lists.  Flux correction factors are calculated to account for potential non-linearities in instrument response with varying exposure times.  Appropriate techniques such as rotating and aligning STIX HXR images with EUI images are used to facilitate comparison.\n\n**3. Principal findings and results:**\n\nThe study demonstrates that short-exposure EUI/FSI observations provide valuable diagnostics of solar flares.  The observations reveal substructure within flaring ribbons that spatially coincide with hard X-ray emission from STIX in most cases.  The analysis of three example flares, including a large X9-class flare and a C1.4-class flare, highlights the improved spatial resolution and dynamic range provided by the short exposure mode.  This enables precise alignment of STIX HXR sources with EUV ribbons. A significant result is the successful comparison between predicted and observed EUV 174 Å emissions for a C1.4 flare. The model accurately captures the peak flux of the short-exposure 174 Å observations during the impulsive phase, demonstrating that most of the EUV emission originates from the chromosphere at this stage. This outcome validates the usefulness of the short exposure mode for inferring electron beam energy fluxes required for flare modeling. The study highlights the usefulness of high cadence short exposure observations for understanding flare energy release and transport processes.\n\n**4. Significance and implications:**\n\nThe work demonstrates the crucial role of short-exposure EUV observations in studying solar flares, specifically in overcoming saturation limitations and revealing finer details in flaring ribbons.  This refined level of detail significantly advances our understanding of particle acceleration and energy release processes.  The study underscores the importance of co-observational data, particularly in cases where ground-based observations are unavailable (e.g., far-side flares). The development of a publicly accessible flarelist with short-exposure EUI data is a valuable contribution to the solar physics community.  The paper further motivates the need for future instruments capable of high cadence, high-resolution EUV observations for a more comprehensive understanding of flare dynamics and a refinement of flare modeling efforts.  The results also demonstrate the potential to refine constraints on electron energy fluxes in flares and understand energy partitioning within them more precisely.

        "summary": "**Compression Method for Solar Polarization Spectra Collected from Hinode SOT/SP Observations**\n\n**1. Main objective and motivation:**\n\nThe paper aims to develop and evaluate deep learning-based compression techniques for solar polarization spectra, specifically focusing on Stokes I and V parameters, to address the growing volume of high-dimensional data from instruments like Hinode SOT/SP.  The motivation stems from the need for efficient data handling, enabling comprehensive analysis of complex solar phenomena, including those associated with active regions, which are often characterized by intricate magnetic fields.  The authors also acknowledge the limited previous work in compressing solar spectra, particularly for active regions and the two-dimensional nature of the data.\n\n\n**2. Key methods and approaches:**\n\nThe authors employ two deep learning architectures: a Deep Autoencoder (DAE) and a 1D Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). Both models aim to learn a compressed representation of the input spectra (Stokes I and V from Hinode SOT/SP).  The models' architectures utilize layers of fully connected neurons (DAE) or 1D convolutional filters (CAE), augmented with batch normalization and an exponential linear unit (ELU) activation function. The encoder reduces the dimensionality of the input, while the decoder reconstructs it. Crucial to this study is the careful preparation of the dataset, including division into training, validation, and test sets, with explicit focus on balancing the representation of quiet Sun and active region data.  Normalization techniques, including min-max scaling for Stokes I and zero-mean scaling for Stokes V, are applied to the input data. The training process employs the Adam optimizer, with early stopping and learning rate reduction to optimize training efficiency.\n\n\n**3. Principal findings and results:**\n\nThe CAE model consistently outperforms the DAE model in reconstructing Stokes I and V profiles, demonstrating higher robustness and achieving reconstruction errors comparable to observational noise levels, even with significant variations in training set data balance.  The optimal bottleneck size was determined through experimentation, with 28 nodes yielding the best results for both models.  Significant improvement is demonstrated in reconstructing Stokes V, often more noisy than Stokes I.  Performance was evaluated using Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) and Chi-squared metrics over specific wavelength regions corresponding to key features in the spectra (absorption lines).  Results show that the CAE, especially, consistently maintains fidelity in reconstructing profiles across all tested data types, including quiet Sun, pores, and sunspot regions, even in the face of varying data balance during training.\n\n\n**4. Significance and implications:**\n\nThe paper presents a novel compression technique applicable to two-dimensional solar polarimetric spectra in both quiet Sun and active regions, a significant advancement over previous methods primarily focused on one-dimensional spectra. The CAE model's robust performance across varying data balance demonstrates its practical value in analyzing potentially complex and high-noise solar spectral data. The approach promises to be useful in various applications, including anomaly detection. The study suggests that the CAE model is a valuable tool for processing and analyzing increasingly large solar spectral datasets, potentially leading to improved discoveries of unusual spectral signals, enabling more comprehensive analyses of solar phenomena, and aiding in better understanding of the solar atmosphere's structure and magnetic fields. Future work should include the addition of Stokes Q and U parameters and broadening analysis to encompass regions beyond the solar disk center.\n",

Main objective and motivation:**\n\nThe study aims to investigate the relationship between rotation and pulsation in δ Scuti (δ Sct) and γ Doradus (γ Dor) stars.  Specifically, the authors want to compare the rotational velocity distributions of these pulsating stars with those of normal main-sequence stars of similar mass and determine if pulsations have an influence on rotational evolution.  They hypothesize that differences in rotation properties between pulsating and non-pulsating stars might be driven by angular momentum transport related to the pulsation modes.\n\n**2. Key methods and approaches:**\n\n* **Data Acquisition:** A large sample of early-type main-sequence stars was compiled from LAMOST spectroscopic data and TESS time-series photometry.  This includes a sizable set of identified δ Sct, γ Dor, and hybrid (δ Sct|γ Dor and γ Dor|δ Sct) stars, plus candidate pulsators.\n* **Contaminant Removal:**  A meticulous process was employed to identify and exclude known contaminants (binaries, chemically peculiar stars, cluster members, etc.) from the data set to ensure a pure sample of normal stars.\n* **Pulsation Classification:** The Lomb-Scargle periodogram method was used to identify the dominant periods of pulsation, and further criteria were applied to classify the pulsating stars into δ Sct, γ Dor, and hybrid categories, with a focus on distinguishing hybrid stars based on the dominant pulsation mode (δ Sct|γ Dor or γ Dor|δ Sct).\n* **Rotational Velocity Analysis:**  Projected rotational velocities (v sin i) were corrected for inclination to derive equatorial rotational velocities.  Bootstrapping techniques were used to estimate uncertainties in these distributions.\n* **Statistical Analysis:** Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests were used to assess statistical significance of differences in rotational velocity distributions between pulsating and normal stars.  Comparison was made across mass and age ranges.\n\n\n**3. Principal findings and results:**\n\n* **Similar Rotational Properties of δ Sct and γ Dor Stars:**  The rotational velocity distributions of δ Sct and γ Dor stars are very similar, differing primarily in the low-velocity end of the distribution, potentially due to residual contaminants.  This similarity suggests that both types of pulsations may have similar effects on rotation.\n* **Different Rotation from Normal Stars:** The rotational velocity distributions of normal stars are more dispersed than those of δ Sct and γ Dor stars, particularly at the higher velocity end.  The peak rotational velocities of pulsating stars are approximately 10 km/s higher than those of normal stars in the studied mass range.\n* **Mass-Rotation Dependence:**  Rotation in normal stars shows a monotonic increase in peak velocity with mass between 1.8 and 2.5 M⊙, which is not observed in δ Sct stars. Their rotation is largely independent of mass.\n* **Evolutionary Effects:** Normal stars show acceleration in rotation during the late main sequence, whereas δ Sct stars show a deceleration.\n* **Amplitude-Rotation Correlation in δ Sct stars:** High-amplitude δ Sct stars are typically rotating slowly, contrasting with the broader rotational distribution of low-amplitude δ Sct stars. This suggests a strong relationship between pulsation amplitude and rotational velocity in δ Sct stars. No similar relationship is observed in γ Dor stars.\n\n**4. Significance and implications:**\n\nThe study provides evidence that stellar pulsations can affect the rotational evolution of stars, specifically by potentially transporting angular momentum from the interior to the surface. This is suggested by the different mass-rotation relationships between pulsating and non-pulsating stars, as well as the observed differences in evolutionary trends for rotation. The similarity in rotational velocity distributions between δ Sct and γ Dor stars supports the idea that p-mode and g-mode pulsations may have similar effects on stellar rotation.  Further study, ideally with larger, cleaner samples, will help solidify these conclusions and fully elucidate the mechanisms. The findings highlight the importance of accounting for pulsation effects when studying the rotation of stars, especially in the mass range covered by δ Sct and γ Dor stars.\n",

        "summary": "**1. Main objective and motivation:**\n\nThe paper investigates the instability of a subsonic gas flow within a flat channel subjected to a transverse force field. This work is motivated by astrophysical applications, particularly the dynamics of astrospheric jets.  The authors aim to model the potential instability of such jets, which can be characterized by a mass force acting on the gas flow, mimicking the effect of a star's azimuthal magnetic field on plasma jets after a shockwave.  The study uses a simplified two-dimensional model of a flat channel to isolate and analyze this instability mechanism, avoiding the complexities of full astrophysical simulations.\n\n\n**2. Key methods and approaches:**\n\nThe authors use a two-dimensional, axisymmetric model of gas flow through a flat channel.  The governing equations are the Euler equations of ideal gas dynamics, accounting for a body force (mass force field) directed towards the channel axis.  This force is implemented as a function of position, either as a discontinuous or continuous field within a specified region of the channel.  A numerical solution method based on Godunov-type control volume methods (specifically, HLLC solvers) is employed on a Cartesian grid.  Important aspects of the numerical approach include the use of parallel processing (CUDA C++) for efficiency and the implementation of soft boundary conditions at the outlet to mitigate reflections and artifacts. To analyze asymmetric instabilities, small, periodic density disturbances are introduced at the inlet to break initial symmetry.\n\n\n**3. Principal findings and results:**\n\nThe study reveals that the presence of the transverse force field induces instability in the subsonic flow.  The nature of the instability depends strongly on the strength of the force field:\n\n* **Weak force field (F ≤ 2.5):**  The instability is symmetric with respect to the channel axis. It exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations with a fundamental period, which seems to correlate with the time for disturbances to propagate across the channel width. The flow pattern suggests a pressure maximum at the channel axis.\n* **Strong force field (F ≥ 4):**  The instability becomes asymmetric, leading to the formation of vortices and potentially more complex flow patterns including features resembling a Karman vortex street. The oscillation spectrum becomes more complex, featuring a mix of low-frequency and a broad spectrum of high-frequency components.\n* **Intermediate force field (F ≈ 3):**  The instability shows a gradual evolution, with parts of the channel exhibiting symmetric behavior and other parts manifesting as asymmetric instability.  This intermediate behavior suggests a transition from symmetric to asymmetric instability as the force increases.\n* **Continuous force field:** Instabilities are observed even with a continuously differentiable force field, demonstrating that the key element driving the instability is the localized pressure gradient, which can be caused by both discontinuous and continuous force functions.\n\nThe authors observe different oscillation patterns and frequencies based on force strength and force field characteristics. Key results are presented as numerical solutions, visualizations (streamlines, pressure, Mach number and vorticity isolines), and spectral analysis (Fourier decomposition) of the flow variables.\n\n\n**4. Significance and implications:**\n\nThis study provides a fundamental understanding of how a transverse force field can induce instability in gas flows, a phenomenon applicable to various scientific domains.  The results offer valuable insights into the dynamics of astrophysical jets. The findings show that even relatively simple models can exhibit complex, self-oscillating behavior under specific conditions, thereby highlighting the complexity of fluid flow.  This knowledge might help predict and interpret observed behaviors in astrophysical jets and potentially stimulate further research on the nonlinear interactions and feedback mechanisms that contribute to jet evolution. The paper also emphasizes the crucial role of numerical methods in tackling such complex fluid dynamics problems in astrophysics. Future research will likely investigate the detailed mechanisms of instability development,  consider more realistic models of the force field, and examine the effects of temperature and other thermodynamic variables.\n",

        "summary": "**Summary of \"The origin channels of hierarchical binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 runs\"**\n\n**1. Main objective and motivation:**\n\nThe paper aims to determine the dominant formation channels (active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks and nuclear star clusters (NSCs)) for hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaborations during their O1, O2, and O3 runs.  Previous work focused primarily on first-generation (1G) mergers, and this study seeks to investigate the contribution of repeated mergers (hierarchical mergers) and their associated astrophysical environments.  Hierarchical mergers are important because they can bridge the mass gap predicted by pair-instability supernovae and can explain the formation of intermediate-mass black holes.\n\n**2. Key methods and approaches:**\n\nA hierarchical Bayesian analysis is employed, using a parametric population model.  The model simulates hierarchical mergers in both AGN disks and NSCs, considering variations in population parameters like black hole mass distributions (PowerLaw+Peak model), spins, mass ratios, and importantly, the escape speed of the host environment (crucial for NSCs). Numerical relativity fits are used to determine the properties (mass, spin, and kick velocity) of the merger remnants.  The likelihood function incorporates the detectable fraction of mergers from each channel, considering the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholds of LVK detectors and observational biases.  A key component is evaluating the posterior distribution of the branching fractions for each formation channel, taking into account the five different BBH merger populations.\n\n**3. Principal findings and results:**\n\nThe analysis indicates that NSCs are the dominant origin channel for hierarchical mergers, accounting for a significant fraction (fNSC = 0.87−0.29+0.10 at 90% credible intervals).  AGN disks could contribute nearly half of the *detectable* hierarchical mergers (fdet,AGN = 0.34−0.26+0.38).  Several population parameters have a substantial impact on inferred branching fractions, including the mass spectral index, spin parameters, and mass ratio distributions.  The escape velocity of NSCs displays a moderate impact, but less so than the other key parameters.  Hierarchical mergers constitute at least 10% of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during O1-O3.  Critically, the analysis highlights the difficulty in precisely inferring detailed properties of the host environment (e.g., escape velocity) when multiple formation channels are present and selection effects are accounted for.\n\n**4. Significance and implications:**\n\nThe study significantly advances our understanding of the formation pathways of hierarchical BBH mergers.  The dominance of NSCs in hierarchical merger rates underscores the importance of dense stellar environments in the formation of these events.  The analysis showcases the crucial role of population parameters, such as mass, spin, and mass ratio distributions, in distinguishing between different merger channels.  The paper further highlights the challenges in extracting precise information about host environments from gravitational wave observations, particularly when multiple formation channels contribute to the observed population.  The findings have implications for modeling the growth of black holes in various astrophysical environments, including galactic nuclei, and informing future LVK data analysis and interpretations.  Future work should aim to include a wider range of hierarchical merger branches and potentially integrate electromagnetic and neutrino observations to refine the picture of hierarchical merger origin.\n",

        "summary": "**Solar Energetic Particle Track Accumulation in Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Dust Grains**\n\n**1. Main objective and motivation:**\n\nThe paper investigates whether Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt (EKB) dust grains can account for the high solar energetic particle (SEP)-induced track density observed in stratospherically collected interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) at 1 AU. This builds upon previous work that suggested EKB grains might transit to the inner solar system, but lacked explicit dynamical modeling incorporating all major perturbing forces. The motivation is to constrain the origin and lifetimes of these high-track-density IDPs.\n\n**2. Key methods and approaches:**\n\nThe study uses a dynamical model of interplanetary dust grain motion, incorporating solar gravity, the gravitational forces of the eight planets, solar radiation pressure, Poynting-Robertson drag, solar wind drag, and the electromagnetic Lorentz force.  The model initializes dust grains with orbital elements drawn from observed EKB object distributions.  A separate model estimates SEP track accumulation rates as a function of heliocentric distance.  The primary approach involves numerically integrating the dust grain trajectories and calculating the accumulated SEP tracks along those trajectories.  Crucially, the paper varies the assumed radial scaling of the SEP flux (r<sup>-α</sup>) to explore its impact on the track accumulation results. This allows comparison with previous work (Keller & Flynn 2022) and explores the influence of planetary perturbations.\n\n**3. Principal findings and results:**\n\nThe study finds that EKB grains can transit to 1 AU, though the probability decreases with increasing grain size.  However, assuming a standard SEP flux scaling with distance (r<sup>-1.7</sup>), the model predicts significantly lower track densities than the observed high-track-density grains.  This discrepancy is confirmed by comparing the dynamical model with an analytical model considering only Poynting-Robertson drag, which consistently predicts higher track densities.  Crucially, the paper demonstrates that planetary perturbations decrease the track density compared to a calculation without them. The presence of Mean-Motion Resonances (MMRs) with outer planets affects the amount of time grains spend at greater distances. With a shallower SEP radial distribution (r<sup>-1.0</sup>), the simulated track densities better match the observations.\n\n**4. Significance and implications:**\n\nThe study highlights the significant role of planetary perturbations in modifying the predicted SEP track accumulation in EKB grains.  The discrepancy between the model and observations under the assumed SEP radial distribution (r<sup>-1.7</sup>) underscores the need for more accurate knowledge of the radial distribution of high-Z SEPs.  The paper emphasizes the necessity of further research into the heliospheric propagation and distribution of these high-Z SEPs to constrain track accumulation in IDPs. The results also point to the potential importance of anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) as an additional track formation source, particularly for grains from the outer EKB. Furthermore, the paper underscores the need for consideration of collisional processes in the EKB, which can affect grain lifetimes and the overall mass flux of EKB grains to 1 AU. This investigation, along with future research, is important for understanding the complex interplay between EKB dynamics, SEP propagation, and the formation of tracks in IDPs.\n",

        "summary": "**Summary of \"On the non-dissipative orbital evolution of a binary system comprising non-compact components with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta\"**\n\n**1. Main objective and motivation:**\n\nThis paper extends previous work by Ivanov and Papaloizou (2021, 2023a,b) on the non-dissipative tidal evolution of binary systems with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta.  The primary objective is to analyze the evolution of such systems where *both* components are non-compact and possess spin angular momentum. This allows for a more realistic modeling of binary systems like DI Her, where both stars are not point masses and their spins are significantly misaligned with the orbital angular momentum.  The motivation is to understand how tidal interactions influence orbital and spin evolution in these systems, particularly the libration or circulation of the apsidal angle near critical curves where the precession rate is zero.\n\n**2. Key methods and approaches:**\n\nThe authors develop a theoretical framework extending previous work to include two non-compact components.  They define a system of equations (25-29 and 30) governing the evolution of orbital angular momentum, spin angular momenta, and angles describing their orientations.  Key methods include:\n\n* **Formalism for non-dissipative tidal evolution:**  The formalism accounts for the effects of inertia and Coriolis forces on the tidal response, leading to a dependence of the torque on the apsidal line orientation.\n* **Analytic approximation for small spin-orbit misalignments:**  Simplifying assumptions are made for the case where the spin angular momenta are small compared to the orbital angular momentum, allowing for an approximate analytic solution. This involves averaging over short timescales.\n* **Numerical simulations:**  The theoretical framework is validated via numerical simulations using the Python SciPy routine *odeint* to solve the differential equations. This allows for exploration of a wider range of parameter space, including cases where the analytic approximations break down.\n* **Modeling of DI Her:**  The authors use stellar models derived from MESA simulations to quantify the tidal interactions in a system analogous to DI Her, providing a crucial practical application.\n\n\n**3. Principal findings and results:**\n\nThe authors find that:\n\n* **Critical curves:**  Critical curves in the parameter space exist where the time-averaged apsidal precession rate is zero, and the spin-orbit inclination remains stationary.  These curves are influenced by the misaligned spins of both components, and their location is calculated numerically.\n* **Libration and circulation:** Systems close to critical curves exhibit librational or circulatory behavior of the apsidal angle, oscillating between prograde and retrograde states, a possibility found in previous studies, but now with greater generality.\n* **Timescales:**  Different timescales govern the evolution, namely those related to apsidal precession, parallel tidal torque evolution, and perpendicular torque-induced variations of spin-orbit angles.  The relative importance of these timescales is analyzed, providing insights into the observed behavior.\n* **DI Her analysis:**  Numerical simulations, applied specifically to DI Her, demonstrate good agreement with theoretical predictions near critical curves. The simulations, however, highlight deviations from the simplified theory for parameters far from critical curves.\n\n\n**4. Significance and implications:**\n\nThe paper makes significant contributions to our understanding of binary systems with misaligned spins. The implications are:\n\n* **Improved theoretical framework:**  It presents a more comprehensive theory for non-dissipative evolution by considering two non-compact components, improving upon previous work.\n* **Insight into DI Her:**  The application to DI Her provides a case study that potentially can inform analysis of this system and similar others.\n* **Identifying critical curves:**  The identification of critical curves and the demonstration of libration/circulation behavior provides a crucial framework for understanding the dynamics of these systems, potentially explaining some observed behaviors.\n* **Future research:**  The paper paves the way for further studies, specifically, by exploring the transition from non-dissipative to dissipative tidal interactions in these complex systems, a critical area often missing from analysis of misaligned binary systems.\n\n\nThe authors successfully extend the theoretical framework, providing insights into the complex dynamics and, in particular, the behavior near critical curves, of misaligned binary systems. The results offer a valuable tool for interpreting observations like those in DI Her and offer directions for future research.\n",
        "insights": "This paper extends previous work on the non-dissipative tidal evolution of binary systems with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta by allowing both components to be non-compact, accounting for their respective spins.\n\n**Key Insights and Lessons Learned:**\n\n* **Non-dissipative torques are present even without dissipation:**  Inertia and Coriolis forces in the tidal response create torques that influence the orbital evolution.\n* **Both rotational distortion and tidal distortion contribute:**  The evolution of spin-orbit inclination angles is driven by torques from both sources.\n* **Critical curves exist for retrograde rotation:**  When spin is small compared to orbital angular momentum, these curves exist only for systems with at least one retrograde-rotating component.\n* **Libration of the apsidal angle near critical curves:** Solutions close to critical curves can lead to oscillations between prograde and retrograde states.\n* **Complexity increases with non-compact components:**  The introduction of the second spin angular momentum makes the dynamical system more complex, requiring both analytical and numerical approaches.\n* **Different timescales govern evolution:**  The evolution is characterized by several timescales, including those related to apsidal precession, parallel torques, and perpendicular torques.\n* **Libration and circulation occur near critical curves:**  Numerical simulations show transitions between librating and circulating behavior of the apsidal angle near critical curves.  The behavior depends on the location of the system in parameter space.\n\n**Questions for the Authors:**\n\n1.

What is the range of applicability of your simplified analytic treatment in relation to the full numerical simulations?  What are the assumptions and limitations of the analytical model?\n5.  How sensitive are the critical curves and the observed behaviors to variations in the parameters (e.g., mass ratios, stellar radii) of the binary system?\n\n**Suggestions for Related Topics/Future Research Directions:**\n\n1.
